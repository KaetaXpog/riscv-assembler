# riscv-assembler
RISC-V Assembly code assembler package.

This package contains tools and functions that can convert RISC-V Assembly code to machine code. The whole process is implemented using Python purely for understandability, less so for efficiency in computation. These tools can be used to convert given lines of code or whole files. For conversion, output file types are binary and text files.

#Installation

The package can be installed using pip:

`pip install riscv_assembler`
